💸 How to Make Money with AI as a Beginner (Step-by-Step)
This project demonstrates how prompt engineering can be used to generate a complete YouTube content package aimed at helping beginners understand how to make money with AI. The video concept fits within the finance, tutorial, and entrepreneurship genres — crafted to be beginner-friendly, practical, and viral-ready.

Through this structured approach, I leveraged AI tools to generate everything from catchy titles to video scripts, thumbnail ideas, and full production-ready outputs — all created within a streamlined prompt chain.
